### Hi, I'm Hannah! (⁠⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠⁠)

I'm a recent BSCS grad from Northeastern University looking for SWE roles in the Boston area! 

Here's a little bit about me...

- I wanna become a pro across the stack, but I'm particularly interested in backend development, cloud engineering, and data engineering! 💻
- My learning passions in my field are in network programming and computer graphics! 🛜
- My professional strengths are diving deep and delivering results! 🐋📨
- As an engineer, I value inclusivity and integrity 🌱
- I like nutrition and fitness, singing in my community choir, video games and following the gaming industry, engaging with the digital art community, and listening to vocal synths! 🏋️‍♀️🎼🎮🎨

Here's a link to my [resume](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Asb-0TM83hCFci4Jj4lEk26kbX4?e=ML6TBJ)! Thanks for stopping by 😊
